# UI Test Plan

### Manual JavaFX checks

Aim: Verify the FXML chat window loads, explains the available commands, responds through both input routes,
remains readable after resizing, scrolls to new messages, and ends input cleanly after `bye`.

Launch command: `./gradlew run` under Java 25.

Actions: Show the Help panel and confirm no edit examples are displayed above the main command buttons; select the
single Edit task button and confirm Edit description, Edit deadline, and Edit event buttons appear beneath it;
select each secondary button and verify its complete sample appears in the command box; close and reopen Help and
confirm the secondary edit buttons are hidden again; enter a mix of valid and invalid commands using both the Enter
key and Send button; compare a valid reply with an invalid-command reply, including a multi-line error; check that
the greeting, user commands, normal replies, errors, and farewell share the same playful message font; check that
each ★ is visible in the greeting, task results, and completed-task markers; add enough
tasks to exceed the visible conversation height; resize the window near its 440-by-560 minimum and then much larger;
open Help at both sizes, including the nested Edit examples; finish with `  BYE  ` and watch the farewell.

Expected observations: The illustrated header, opening greeting, avatars, and Help button appear; the command list
stays hidden until Help is clicked; one Edit task button appears in the main list; its three secondary buttons stay
hidden until Edit task is clicked and use the documented description, deadline, and combined event syntax; each
secondary suggestion fills the command box without sending immediately; closing Help collapses the edit choices;
every non-blank command produces the same response as the console application; validation errors use a pale warm
background, dark red border, readable text, and Toothless avatar while successful replies keep their normal style;
blank input adds no bubbles; the newest exchange remains visible in a vertically scrolling conversation; message
bubbles use the available width and long replies wrap without clipping; the input stretches while Send remains visible;
conversation text uses Comic Neue while the header, Help panel, buttons, and input retain their existing fonts;
stars are visible rather than missing-glyph boxes, including when a long message wraps around a star;
Help examples wrap or scroll within their panel; avatars keep their proportions; and all input controls and command
suggestions become disabled after the farewell response; the window remains responsive during the brief delay and
closes automatically about 1.8 seconds later.

## TC-01: Interleaved valid and invalid commands preserve task state

Aim: Verify empty and unknown input, every task format, malformed separators, all task-number errors, additional spaces, continuation after errors, and unchanged task count, ordering, and star statuses.

```text
/bin/zsh -lc 'source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh" && sdk use java 25.0.3.fx-zulu >/dev/null && ./gradlew -q classes && TOOTHLESS_TEST_ROOT=$(mktemp -d) && TOOTHLESS_CLASSES="$PWD/build/classes/java/main:$PWD/build/resources/main" && cd "$TOOTHLESS_TEST_ROOT" && java -Dos.name="Mac OS X" -cp "$TOOTHLESS_CLASSES" toothless.Toothless'

## TC-09: Edit task fields without changing task identity or state

## TC-02: Validate deadline dates without changing task state

Aim: Verify missing, incorrectly formatted, impossible, non-leap, and malformed dates are rejected without stack traces or task-list changes; leap-day and whitespace-surrounded dates remain usable through listing, marking, unmarking, and deletion.

Command:

```text
